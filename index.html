							<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable achievements in applications ranging from autonomous driving, object manipulation, or beating best players in complex board-games. 
								However, elementary problems of RL remain open: exploratory and learned policies may cause unsafe situations, lack task-robustness, or be unstable. 
								By satisfactorily addressing these problems, RL research will have long-lasting impact and see breakthroughs on real physical systems and in human-centered environments. 
								<br />
								<br />
								Different communities have proposed multiple techniques to increase safety, transparency, and robustness of RL. 
								The aim of this workshop is to provide a multidisciplinary platform to (1) jointly identify and clearly define the major challenges in RL, (2) propose and debate existing approaches to ensure desired properties of learned policies from various perspectives, and (3) discuss benchmarks to accelerate RL research. 
								<!-- This could foster researchers’ awareness of progress and concerns from other communities, and promote collaborations among different communities, such as formal methods and machine learning to solve the challenges of RL.  -->
								The themes of the workshop would comprise (but not be limited to) RL and control theory, RL and Human-Robot Interaction, RL and Formal Methods, benchmarking of RL, etc.

									<p> Title: Safe Exploration with Constrained Reinforcement Learning</p>
									<p> Abstract: this talk, we will advocate for constrained reinforcement learning as a key formalism for safety in the context of safe exploration problems and safe RL more broadly. We will discuss challenges in benchmarking progress in safe exploration, and present Safety
 Gym, a suite of environments and tools intended to meet that need. We will additionally present Lagrangian PID methods, a recent algorithmic development that improves the state of the art for constraint satisfaction and robustness as measured with Safety Gym
 environments. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of the gaps between safety research and safety practice, and describe how we might use lessons from the engineering discipline of systems safety to inform our future research. </p>

									<p> Title: Learning More from the Past: Offline Batch RL </p>
									<p> Abstract: There is a huge opportunity for enhancing evidence-driven decision making by leveraging the increasing amount of data collected about decisions made, and their outcomes. Reinforcement learning is a natural framework to capture this setting, but online reinforcement learning may always be feasible for higher stakes domains like healthcare or education. In this talk I will discuss our work on offline, batch reinforcement learning, and the progress we have made in techniques that can work efficiently with limited data, and under limited assumptions about the domain. </p>

									<p> Abstract: Socially Interactive Learning: On the interpretation of human teaching signals </p>
									<p> There are increasing situations in which humans and AI systems are acting, deciding and/or learning. In this short talk, we discuss approaches and models able to capture specific strategies of humans while they are teaching agents. We will see how social learning based approaches make it possible to take into account such strategies in the development of interactive machine learning techniques and in particular when it comes to social robotics. </p>

									<p> Title: Scaling Up Deep Reinforcement Learning via Preference-based Learning: Feedback-efficient Algorithm and Benchmark </p>
									<p> Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successful in a range of challenging domains, such as board games, video games, and robotic control tasks. Scaling RL to many applications, however, is yet precluded by a number of challenges. One such challenge lies in designing a suitable reward function that is sufficiently informative yet easy enough to provide. Human-in-the-loop RL methods allow practitioners to instead interactively teach agents through tailored feedback; however, such approaches have been challenging to scale since human feedback is very expensive. In this talk, I’ll present PEBBLE: a feedback-efficient RL algorithm by which learning is largely autonomous and supplemented by a practical number of preferences provided by a supervisor. Based on off-policy RL and unsupervised pre-training, our method is able to utilize real-time human feedback to effectively prevent reward exploitation and learn new behaviors that are difficult to specify with standard reward functions. Additionally, I’ll introduce B-Pref: a benchmark specially designed for preference-based RL to further our understanding of the strengths of existing algorithms. . </p>
									<p> Bio: Kimin Lee is a postdoc at UC Berkeley working with Prof. Pieter Abbeel. He is interested in the directions that enable scaling deep reinforcement learning to diverse and challenging domains — human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, unsupervised reinforcement learning, and reinforcement learning from pixels. He received his Ph.D. from KAIST, where he worked on a reliable and robust machine/deep learning with Prof. Jinwoo Shin. During Ph.D., he also interned and collaborated closely with Prof. Honglak Lee at University of Michigan. </p>

									<p> Title: Modelling Uncertainty in Simulation Parameters for Robust Reinforcement Learning </p>
									<p> Abstract: Model-free methods and physics models have been mostly utilised as separate tools to train robust policies that perform well in the real world. We aim to close this gap and develop machine learning methods that, as much as possible, integrate prior knowledge into the pipeline. Recent advancements in Bayesian inference enables a probabilistic treatment for the problem of estimating model parameters and their uncertainty given sequences of observations. In this talk, I will describe the integration of parameter inference for scientific simulators with both model-free reinforcement learning and model-based control in a novel sequential algorithm that alternates between learning a better estimation of parameters and improving automated decision making. This approach exploits the interdependence between the two problems to generate computational efficiencies and improved reliability when a physics simulator is available. Experimental results suggest that these strategies have better performance compared to pure machine learning methods.  </p>

									<p> Title: Bringing in the Human in the (Reinforcement) Learning Loop </p>
									<p> Abstract: Today, I will talk about the challenges of bringing in humans in the learning loop. Specifically, I will discuss how we can be more data-efficient in robotics when learning from humans by actively querying them. However, this is often not practical in RL settings due to the complexity of active learning of large neural models. Instead, I will go over two approaches that address the need for human data in RL settings: First, I will discuss a modular approach that incorporates inductive biases and enables faster adaptation to human partners. Second, I will briefly discuss how active data acquisition can be helpful for RL agents. Finally, I will conclude by showing that bringing in humans in the learning loop can enable us to aim for more interesting objectives beyond reacting. As an example, we can develop RL agents that can act in non-stationary environments or influence human partners toward more desirable outcomes. </p>

									<p> Title: Verifiable reinforcement learning systems </p>
									<p> Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms offer tremendous capabilities in systems that work in unknown environments. However, there remain significant barriers to their deployment in safety-critical engineering applications. For example, the verification of reinforcement learning systems is complex, and this is particularly true of monolithic end-to-end learning approaches that have been gaining popularity. In this presentation, I focus on the following question: How can we build trustworthy engineering systems that rely on reinforcement learning? I will present a series of recent results that seek answers for this question at the intersection of formal methods and reinforcement learning. I will detail two of these results on (i) verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning and (ii) cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. </p>
									<p> Bio: Ufuk Topcu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at The University of Texas at Austin. He is a core faculty member at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. Ufuk obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 2008. Prior to joining The University of Texas at Austin, he was with the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a postdoctoral scholar at California Institute of Technology until 2012. Ufuk’s research focuses on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the design and verification of autonomous systems, typically in the intersection of formal methods, reinforcement learning, and control theory. He takes a relatively broad view on autonomy and tends to tackle abstract problems motivated by challenges cutting across multiple applications of autonomy. His research contributions have been recognized by the NSF CAREER Award, the Air Force Young Investigator Award, the IEEE CSS Antonio Ruberti Young Researcher Prize, and Oden Institute Distinguished Researcher Award. </p>

							<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
							
							
							<p> We invite extended abstract submissions of recent works, preliminary work with open questions is very welcome, related to the theme of the workshop. All accepted abstracts will be part of a short paper presentation session held during the workshop, where the authors will have the opportunity to present their lines of work in a 2-minutes-long video that will be played during the workshop, and followed by a 3-minutes live Q&A session. This is a non-archival venue: there will be no formal proceedings, but we encourage the authors to publish their extended abstracts on Arxiv (where the link will be placed on the workshop’s website). Abstracts may be submitted to other venues in the future. </p>
							
							<p> Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) applications of Reinforcement Learning to:
								<ul>
								  <li>Formal Methods</li>
								  <li>Control</li>
								  <li>Human-Robot Interaction</li>
								</ul>
